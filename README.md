## Overview

The Pneumonia Detection App is a desktop application designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning. The application features a user-friendly interface built with PyQt5 and utilizes a TensorFlow-KERAS based model for image recognition. 
It provides real-time results through visual and audio feedback.

Also, image-based data Numonia detection dashboard, powered by a deep learning model built on the VGG16 architecture.   
- This model leverages the power of neural networks to classify and analyze medical images with high accuracy.  
- At the heart of our solution is the VGG16 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. We've fine-tuned it by adding custom layers on top. To maintain efficiency, we've kept the original VGG16 layers frozen and focused our training on the custom layers we've added.  
- Our dashboard is designed to process and classify medical images seamlessly. Users can upload an image, and the system will analyze it, predict the class of the image.   
- One of the standout features of our dashboard is the real-time audio announcement of results. Once the model makes a prediction, also popup  result will immediately displayed on the screen with a color-coded messageâ€”green for positive results and red for negative results. making it easy for users to understand the outcome instantly. Additionally, we've included a text-to-speech function to read out the results loundly all kind of users.  
- This functionality is particularly useful in clinical settings where quick and clear communication is critical. Additionally, the text-to-speech capability enhances accessibility, making our system user-friendly.
